## Introduction

Finding an appropriate place to start a restuarant is of ut-most importance, for several reasons. It is a large financial commitment, and if there is not sufficient customer base, one could quickly go out of business. A hard-working entrepreneur is seeking to open an authentic indian restuarant and would like it to be in the Toronto area, Ontario, Canada. This client requests to find an area to place this restaurant wherein maximal profit could result. Ideally, the client would like to house this restuarant in an area where there is not substantial competition. However, existence of only a few indian restuarants in an area may mean that there are a considerable amount of customers and market share could possibly be taken away from them with the right strategy. Perfoming data analysis will attempt to lock in a neighborhood or an area of possible interest to the client using these key parameters. 


## Data 

Several groups of data will need to be utilized for this study. The Foursquare database will need to be utilized to find the density of indian restuarants, as well as location and neighborhood data. Foursquare API calls will be conducted to find locations of existing indian restuarants, while location data will be obtained from an csv file originating from the Geocoder Python package. Lastly, neighborhood data will be collected from the Wikipedia page, "List of postal codes of Canada: M". A K-means clustering algorithm will be applied to group areas in accordance to the quantity of indian restuarants.
