# Cousera_Capstone Project 
## "Battle of the Neighborhoods"
Repository for capstone project from coursera

## Introduction

The problem in the following scenario is being addressed: A hard-working entrepreneur is seeking to open a restuarant area and would like it to be in the Toronto area, in Canada. Unfortunately, this client is unsure of where to place this restuarant wherein maximal profit can result. As this client is a skilled award-winning chef, the menu will likely be on the pricier side. Ideally, one would want to be in an area with a plethora of foot traffic (i.e., where there are plenty of things to do and even some restuarants nearby). Also, one does not want to be located in an area with a high crime rate, in that loss of property could place the client out of business. Perfoming data analysis will attempt to lock in a neighborhood or an area of possible interest to the client.
